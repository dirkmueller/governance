# OpenELA Governance Contribution Guidelines

## Scope

This document describes how contributions to the OpenELA governance repository
are handled. For information on how to contributing to OpenELA in general,
please refer to the [Contributor Guidelines](contributors_guidelines.md)instead.

The openELA governance repository contains all the technical project governance
descriptions which includes steps for contribution and review of contributions
amongst other things.

## main branch only

The governance repository is unbranched and the tip of the tree of main
describes the current state of governance.

## Submit as early as possible

We encourage changes to be discussed in the open. If you're unsure about the
potential acceptance of a proposed change, you are welcome to create a Pull
Request to gauge interest. If you're doing a PR and are not yet ready to accept
review comments, please mark it as Draft instead.

## Sign-off on submissions

Changes should be signed off using the DCO ([Developerâ€™s Certificate of
Origin](https://developercertificate.org/), as defined in the [Linux Kernel
documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst)).

## Ensure that the markdown linting is happy

Pull requests to the repository are undergoing some markdown linting. Without
the lint check passing the pull request is not elligible to be mergeable into
the repository.

## Peer Review

Changes to the governance repository are peer-reviewed by the active members of
the OpenELA Technical Governance. For merging a PR, one review is required. If
a member of the Technical Governance is proposing the PR, the review needs to
be provided by a different member of the Technical Governance, ideally from a
different company to avoid a conflict of interest situation.

## How to Handle Stuck Pull Requests

If a Pull Request is not reviewed in time, there are a couple of options:

* Double check that no member of the Technical Governance has left a
  comment,maybe without the "Requesting Change" label that still warrants
  discussion or feedback
* Give the members of the Technical Governance sufficient time to discover and
  assess your contribution. A two weeks period should be assumed given vacation
  or travel times of individuals.

If there seems to be no blocking issue and sufficient time has passed, it
is possible to ask for an update in the Pull Request.
